Category Description: Tech Debt/Modernization

LeadVenture has two separate applications for VIN Decoding - one for Retail clients and the other for Wholesale clients.  The Accion Team recommended building APIs that check the two databases (as using a single database is not an option currently), when new VINs are created or updates were done. This has lead to huge time-savings (as the dealer does not have to check multiple places) and productivity and financial gains, leading to added revenue. Fetching the VIN data from a 3rd party data provider cost LV money, and this code helped save money by avoiding multiple hits to the 3rd party database. The VIN data was also reused helping improve revenue and margins.

Problem statement: Lead hunter website landing page was taking about ~3 minutes to load
Value solution (Mention LLMs, Tools used): Earlier, the data was being calculated by joining multiple tables, some of which were located in different databases. This approach was inefficient and impacted performance.

To address this, we proposed running a scheduled job that fetches and consolidates the required data every 4 hours. The client application will then retrieve the information directly from this prefetched table, ensuring faster response times and reduced load on the underlying databases.

Implemented new architecture with CQRS pattern which gets its data from a flat seprate table with prefectched value. It works as deffered fetch as volume of data is in 200 Millions. The solution reduced the load time to less than 3 seconds.

Problem statement: Currently, the user deletion service is not restricted to a single execution. It may run concurrently across multiple instances of the by-users-service, which is not the intended behavior.
Value solution (Mention LLMs, Tools used): At any given time, only one instance of the user service should acquire the distributed lock and perform the stale user deletion.
All other instances should skip the deletion logic if the lock is already held. Redis is used as the distributed locking mechanism to coordinate this behavior.

The solution implemented ensures that the stale user deletion logic within the user service executes only once across multiple service instances in any given environment. This is to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency in a microservices architecture.

Problem statement: Email sending feature is crashing at peak hours due to bottleneck of large volume table insertion
Value solution (Mention LLMs, Tools used): The PSM application uses SendGrid for sending emails. To track these emails, we log each record into a normalized table which also supports various reporting needs. Currently, this table holds ~700 million records.

The challenge was that direct insertions into this table were taking ~10 minutes for 5,000 records, and in some cases, the process would even crash due to the high indexing overhead.

Solution implemented:

Introduced a staging table without indexes to handle incoming inserts efficiently.

Data is then moved in batches from this staging table to the original normalized table.

This approach has significantly reduced insertion time and improved system stability for large-scale email tracking.
