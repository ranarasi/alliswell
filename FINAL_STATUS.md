## 📋 What YOU Need To Do Next

###Once npm installations complete (check with `ls backend/node_modules`):

### Step 1: Run Complete Setup

```bash
cd /Users/ramesh/Documents/projects/claude-alliswell
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH"
./run-complete-setup.sh
```

This automatically does:
- Creates database
- Runs migrations
- Seeds users
- Creates .env files

**Time:** 1-2 minutes

---

### Step 2: Start Backend

Open a new terminal window:

```bash
cd /Users/ramesh/Documents/projects/claude-alliswell/backend
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH"
npm run dev
```

Wait for: `✓ Server running on port 3001`

---

### Step 3: Start Frontend

Open ANOTHER new terminal window:

```bash
cd /Users/ramesh/Documents/projects/claude-alliswell/frontend
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/node@20/bin:$PATH"
npm run dev
```

Wait for: `✓ Ready on http://localhost:3000`

## 📁 Helper Scripts Created

I've created these scripts to help you:

1. **`run-complete-setup.sh`** - Complete database and environment setup
2. **`START_APP.md`** - Detailed startup instructions
3. **`INSTALLATION_COMPLETE.md`** - Installation summary
4. **`verify-setup.sh`** - Check what's installed

---

## 🔍 Check Installation Progress

To see if npm installations are done:

```bash
# Check backend
ls /Users/ramesh/Documents/projects/claude-alliswell/backend/node_modules

# Check frontend
ls /Users/ramesh/Documents/projects/claude-alliswell/frontend/node_modules
```

If you see folders listed, installations are complete!

## 🎯 Database Configuration (Already Set Up in Code)

The application is configured to connect to PostgreSQL with:

```
Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database: alliswell

This will all work automatically when you run `./run-complete-setup.sh`
